            At StylesAtEase, we are committed to protecting your privacy and
            ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy
            Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the
            information you provide when using our website. By accessing or

          <h3 className="mt-2 font-semibold">Information Collection and Use</h3>
          <p>
            We collect personal information such as your name, email address,
            phone number, and payment details when you book appointments through
            our website. This information is necessary for scheduling
            appointments, processing payments, and providing you with the
            requested services. We may also collect non-personal information
            such as browser type, operating system, and IP address for analytics
            and security purposes.
          </p>
          <h3 className="mt-2 font-semibold">Information Sharing</h3>
          <p>
            We may share your personal information with third-party service
            providers, such as payment processors and appointment management
            systems, to facilitate the booking process and provide you with the
            requested services. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal
            information to third parties for marketing purposes. However, we may
            disclose your information when required by law or to protect our
            rights, property, or safety.
          </p>
          <h3 className="mt-2 font-semibold">Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your
            personal information from unauthorized access, alteration,
            disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over
            the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot
            guarantee absolute security.
